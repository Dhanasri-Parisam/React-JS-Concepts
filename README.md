# React.js Roadmap — Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced

> A concise, practical roadmap for learning React.js from scratch and building real-world apps. Paste this into your GitHub `README.md` as your learning guide.

---

## How to use this roadmap

1. Follow the sections in order: **Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced**.
2. For each item: read, practice with a small demo, then build a tiny project that uses those concepts.
3. Track progress by checking off items and pushing small repos for each project.

---

## Prerequisites

* Comfortable with HTML, CSS (flexbox, grid) and JavaScript (ES6+): `let/const`, arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, `classes`, `modules`.
* Basic CLI and Git/GitHub usage.

---

# Beginner (Core fundamentals)

Start here if you are new to React. Focus: component model, JSX, state & props.

### 1. What is React?

* Library for building UIs using components and declarative rendering.
* Virtual DOM concept and one-way data flow.

### 2. Create React App / Vite

* How to scaffold a new app with `create-react-app` and `Vite`.
* Project folder structure (src/, public/, components/).

### 3. JSX

* Embedding expressions, attributes, `className`, `style` object, conditional rendering.

### 4. Components

* Functional components (preferred) and difference vs class components (conceptual knowledge only).
* Component composition, children, file organization.

### 5. Props and State

* Passing data with props, default props, propTypes (optional).
* `useState` hook basics; lifting state up.

### 6. Events & Forms

* Handling events, controlled vs uncontrolled inputs, form submission.

### 7. Conditional Rendering & Lists

* `&&`, ternary, early return, `Array.map()` and `key` prop.

### 8. Styling

* Plain CSS, CSS Modules, SASS basics, styled-components concept, Tailwind introduction.

### 9. Basic project ideas (practice)

* Todo App (add/edit/delete, localStorage)
* Simple Weather UI (static mock data)
* Github profile card (fetching static JSON)

---

# Intermediate (Build real apps & structure)

Focus: hooks, side-effects, routing, API interaction, state management patterns.

### 1. useEffect and lifecycle

* `useEffect` patterns: data fetching, subscriptions, cleanup, dependency arrays.

### 2. Custom Hooks

* Extracting reusable logic into custom hooks (e.g., `useFetch`, `useDebounce`).

### 3. Routing

* `react-router` basics: routes, nested routes, route params, protected routes.

### 4. Data Fetching

* `fetch` and `axios`, async/await, error handling, loading states.
* Stale-while-revalidate pattern concept.

### 5. State Management Patterns

* React Context API (when to use, pitfalls).
* Local vs global state, derived state.
* Introduction to external libraries (why and when): Redux, Zustand, Jotai, Recoil.

### 6. Forms & Validation

* Controlled forms, `react-hook-form`, `Formik` + `Yup` validation.

### 7. Testing

* Unit testing components with `Jest` + `React Testing Library` (render, fireEvent, queries).
* Snapshot testing (sparingly).

### 8. Performance Optimization

* `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` — when they help and when they don't.
* Code-splitting with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.

### 9. Accessibility (a11y)

* Semantic HTML, ARIA basics, keyboard navigation, focus management.

### 10. Intermediate project ideas

* CRUD app with REST API (e.g., Notes app) + search, pagination.
* E-commerce product list with filters, cart state (use Context or Zustand).
* Dashboard with charts (use `recharts` or `chart.js`).

---

# Advanced (Scalability, architecture, advanced patterns)

Focus: strong engineering practices, advanced performance, Server-Side Rendering, TypeScript, DevOps considerations.

### 1. TypeScript with React

* Strict typing for props, state, hooks, generics for reusable components.
* Migrate a small JS app to TS.

### 2. Advanced State Management

* Redux Toolkit patterns: slices, async thunks / RTK Query.
* When to use global state vs local state vs server state (React Query / TanStack Query).

### 3. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Frameworks

* Next.js fundamentals: file-based routing, SSR (getServerSideProps), SSG (getStaticProps), ISR.
* When to pick Next.js vs CRA/Vite-based SPA.

### 4. Data Caching & Synchronization

* TanStack Query (React Query) / SWR: caching, background refetch, optimistic updates.

### 5. Micro-Frontends & Module Federation

* High-level concept and when to consider splitting large apps.

### 6. Performance at Scale

* Profiling with React DevTools Profiler, Lighthouse.
* Web vitals, image optimization, prefetching, critical CSS.

### 7. Design Systems & Component Libraries

* Building a design system, tokenization, accessible components.
* Using Storybook for component development and docs.

### 8. Build & Deployment

* CI/CD basics: GitHub Actions to run tests, build, and deploy.
* Hosting: Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages; environment variables management.

### 9. Security

* XSS prevention, secure handling of tokens, CORS basics, rate limiting considerations.

### 10. Observability & Monitoring

* Logging, Sentry for error monitoring, performance tracing basics.

### 11. Advanced project ideas

* Full-stack Next.js app with authentication, server-side rendering, and API routes.
* Real-time collaborative app using WebSockets or Firebase.
* Large-scale dashboard with micro-frontends or module federation.

# Suggested learning path (week-by-week example)

* Week 1–2: Beginner topics + 2 small projects.
* Week 3–4: Hooks, routing, data fetching + 1 medium project.
* Week 5–8: TypeScript, testing, performance + one full-stack Next.js project.

---

# Interview & portfolio tips

* Build 3 polished projects: one UI-focused, one full-stack, one that demonstrates system design or performance.
* Show commits with meaningful messages, small PRs, and issues/README for each project.
* Add a `Projects` section to your GitHub profile and pin your 3 best repos.

---

# Resources (books, courses, docs)

* Official React docs (always primary source).
* Next.js docs for SSR/SSG.
* Redux Toolkit docs, TanStack Query docs.
* React Testing Library guide.
* Storybook docs.

---
